# Olimpiadi Italiane di Informatica

This is the main container of tool projects and web services of the _Olimpiadi Italiane di Informatica (OII)_. Other organizations were used in the past for similar purposes and still contain active projects not yet migrated into this organization:

- [algorithm-ninja](https://github.com/algorithm-ninja)
- [olinfo](https://github.com/olinfo)

The `task-maker-rust` project is instead split across various personal github accounts:

- [task-maker-rust](https://github.com/edomora97/task-maker-rust)
- [tabox (sandbox)](https://github.com/alerighi/tabox)
- [dp1 (ubuntu ppa)](https://github.com/dp1/task-maker-rust-ppa)
- [bortoz (brew formula)](https://github.com/bortoz/homebrew-bortoz/blob/master/Formula/task-maker-rust.rb)

Private data and projects of the OII are instead located in a dedicated self-hosted git repository:

- [self-hosted git](https://git.olinfo.it)

Older private data and projects are still hosted on the `olimpiadi-informatica` organization on gitlab:

- [olimpiadi-informatica (gitlab.com)](https://gitlab.com/olimpiadi-informatica)

The OII, together with other olympiads, also participate into the organization _Italian Scientific Olympiad_ dedicated to the development of `olimanager` shared platform for national contests:
